#Bioarcheaology in R

This repo documents the potential that R programming has in Bioarcheaological analysis. 

There are two sections which represent two separate projects:

1. BioProfile. Is a shiny app which uses the results of standard osteological methods to create a basic biological profile (age, sex and ancestry).  This folder contains the files that are needed to run the app  as well as separate annotated r files for each of the functions used by the app.  These are annotated with the non-coder in mind. The working app can be found at https://alisjay.shinyapps.io/BioProfile. And a short presentation on it is found at http://alisjay.github.io/BioProfile/BioProfile_presentation/index.html#1. 

2. Health Index. The folder contains a sequence of raw r markdown file (and their pdf outputs) that document the analysis of the health index dataset.The dataset was collected as part of the western hemisphere module of the global history of health project is available from http://global.sbs.ohio-state.edu/western_hemisphere_module.htm. The analysis aims to approximately recreate in reproducible code the Health Index analysis as detailed in The backbone of history: Health and nutrition in the western hemisphere (ed.Steckel & Rose,2002). The sequence of files goes: CleaningData, ExploratoryAnalysis,CorrectData and HealthIndex. Also included in this folder are the data and annotated functions.
